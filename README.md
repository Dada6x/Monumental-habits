## 🧠 Overview

**Monumental Habits** is a beautifully designed **habit tracking app** built with **Flutter**, focused on helping users build consistency and mindfulness through clean UI and smooth functionality.

The app lets you **create, track, and visualize your daily habits**, while keeping you motivated with **reminders**, **progress tracking**, and a vibrant **community** space.

This project is inspired by the [Habit Builder UI Kit](https://www.pixeltrue.com/free-ui-kits/habit-builder-ui-kit) from PixelTrue, which we customized and redesigned — including an original **Dark Clouded Theme** created in Figma to match our **sky/cloudy** aesthetic.
